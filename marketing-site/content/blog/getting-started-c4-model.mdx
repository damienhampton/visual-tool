# Getting Started with C4 Model Diagrams

The C4 model is a simple and effective way to visualize software architecture. Created by Simon Brown, it provides a hierarchical approach to documenting systems at different levels of detail.

## What is the C4 Model?

The C4 model consists of four levels:

### 1. System Context
Shows how your system fits into the world around it. Who uses it? What other systems does it interact with?

### 2. Container
Zooms into your system to show the high-level technical building blocks (applications, databases, file systems, etc.).

### 3. Component
Zooms into an individual container to show the components inside it.

### 4. Code
Shows how a component is implemented (optional, often generated from code).

## Why Use C4 Diagrams?

- **Clarity**: Each level provides the right amount of detail for different audiences
- **Consistency**: Standard notation makes diagrams easy to understand
- **Scalability**: Works for systems of any size
- **Version Control**: Can be stored as code alongside your application

## Creating Your First Diagram

With 26 Diagrams, creating C4 diagrams is simple:

1. **Sign up** for a free account
2. **Create a new diagram** and select your C4 level
3. **Drag and drop** elements onto the canvas
4. **Connect** elements with relationships
5. **Collaborate** with your team in real-time
6. **Export** your diagram as PNG, SVG, or JSON

## Best Practices

- Start with the System Context diagram
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep diagrams focused and uncluttered
- Update diagrams when architecture changes
- Store diagram JSON files in your repository
