# Why We Built 26 Diagrams

Architecture documentation is hard. We've all been there - outdated diagrams, inconsistent notation, and tools that either do too much or too little.

## The Problem

As developers and architects, we love tools like Miro for their ease of use and flexibility. But when it comes to architecture diagrams, we need more structure. We need:

- **Consistent notation** (like C4 model)
- **Version control** integration
- **Real-time collaboration**
- **Export to code-friendly formats**

On the other hand, tools like Structurizr provide great structure but lack the intuitive, free-form experience we're used to.

## Our Vision

We wanted to combine the best of both worlds:

- The **ease of use** of Miro
- The **structure** of Structurizr
- The **collaboration** of modern tools
- The **version control** developers expect

## What Makes 26 Diagrams Different

### Purpose-Built for C4
We're not trying to be everything to everyone. We focus on C4 model diagrams and do them really well.

### Developer-Friendly
Export diagrams as JSON/YAML to commit alongside your code. Keep documentation in sync with your application.

### Real-Time Collaboration
Work with your team in real-time. See cursors, edits, and changes instantly.

### Modern Tech Stack
Built with React, Next.js, and modern web technologies for a fast, smooth experience.

## The Road Ahead

We're just getting started. Here's what's coming:

- Import from infrastructure-as-code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Generate diagrams from ADRs
- Advanced auto-layout algorithms
- Team workspaces and permissions
- API access for automation
